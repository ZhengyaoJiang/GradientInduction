# GradientInduction
Replication of "Learning Explanatory Rules from Noisy Data" http://www.jair.org/media/5714/live-5714-10391-jair.pdf
They built a differentiable first order logic deduction algorithm which can be trained with gradient based optimization,
and thus "learning the explanatory rules".
